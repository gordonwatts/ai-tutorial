# Introduction

Plan for a 50 minute workshop given for people 10+ years of age.

## Goals

- Kids have an intuitive feeling of how ML works

## Prep

The computers will need some software installed for this to work. This release works only on Windows computers.

1. Copy the zip file (that is part of the release) into the desktop, and unpack.
2. Run the "1 - Play Super Mario" file. Make sure you can play (hit the return key to start, left and right arrows to move).
3. If they keys do not work, then select the `Options` -> `Button Mapping` and then configure the return and left and right button. Even thought they look correct!
4. I would suggest testing the rest to make sure they worked as expected so there are no suprised during the tutorial.

## During the 50 Minutes

| Time (minutes) | Description |
| :-----------------: | ---------- |
| 0-5 | Everyone get settled, use slide on screen to have them double click on the plain SM game to start|
| 5-10 | Have everyone play the game. Especially new people. Watch yourself as you learn. Slide on basics of hwo to play and the goal of the game. |
| 10-15 | Some discussion of how learning works. Repetition, talking to partners, watching others, trying & failing. |
| 15-20 | Intro machine learning - a simple slide talking about repetitive learning. |
| 20-25 | Have kids start the learning thing and watch it for a few minutes. |
| 25-30 | Slides on rain in Seattle (and football). Predict rain. Have them guess the next year's rain fall. Then show fitting. Talk about how it is a really simple math equation. |
| 30-35 | Show repetitive way to find the proper line - use participation. What if I threw up a line to fit it anywhere. Then ask them which direction I should move it. Etc. Etc. Make the point this is exactly what is happening on their screens. |
| 35-40 | Explain it takes a long time. Load up a ML thing that has trained all night. Watch how well it is doing. |
| 40-45 | Give some other examples up on the screen (like the handwriting??). |
| 45-50 | Questions, and then hang out afterwards and be willing to answer all sorts of questions. |

## History

| When | Where |
